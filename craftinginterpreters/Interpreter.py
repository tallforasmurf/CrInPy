# Interpret Lox

Interpret and execute Lox code, working on a syntax tree of Stmt objects, as
prepared by Parser.py. Refer to book section 8.1 and forward.

The interpreter is implemented as a "visitor" for the tree composed of Stmt
objects. When interpreting an Expression, it "visits" the tree of Expr
objects. As such it has methods that correspond to (eventually) all of the
methods defined in the StmtVisitor and ExprVisitor classes.

    As with the Scanner and Parser classes, Nystrom expects to report errors

        "globals" since that's what this level is.

        Define the "locals" as a dict. This is initialized by the Resolver so

        to Chapter 11 and Resolver.py, and see the resolve() method below.

        The keys of the dict are not simple identifiers, but Expr instances.
        Each separate reference to an identifier is represented in the parsed
        program by an Expr.Variable or Expr.Assign which is a unique object.
        Thus there is no fear of name-collisions in the mapping; and each
        reference is related to its access-depth at the syntactic point it
        was found.

    Utility functions
    -----------------

    U1. Specify what's a truthy Lox value. (Can we get a shout-out to Steven
    Colbert here?) Nystrom specifies Lox to use Ruby's rule, by which only
    false and nil are false -- unlike C and Python, where 0 is also False;
    and unlike Python where a null string or empty collection is False.

    Note in this Python implementation, a Lox nil is represented as None, and
    Lox true and false literals are Python True and False. See Parser.py,
    primary().

    statements produce no values, so the return type of the visit methods is
    Void, not Object." And all his visitXxx methods have an explicit "return
    null". In Python, the default for any method that doesn't execute
    "return" is to return None, so I am not reproducing those "return null"s

    E7. Evaluate a Binary expression.

    Get the left and right values, then do the thing. A special case is that
    + is overloaded to be a string concatenator.

    Another point worth noting: Lox restricts <,> comparisons to numbers.

    As with unary minus, we attempt float conversion which might raise a
    ValueError exception. Also SLASH could cause a ZeroDivisionError. Convert
    both to our EvaluationError.

        Handle the overloading of PLUS. The initial Lox spec requires both
        operands to be of the same type. Challenge #1 at end of chapter asks,
        how about if either operand is a string, make both strings, so
        "scone"+4 -> "scone4".

        But by that rule, "3"+4 -> "34". I can see equal justification for
        saying, if either operand is numeric, try to convert the other to
        numeric and do numeric addition. Whichever you do, some user will
        find you being "inconsistent". Generally I don't think it is a good
        idea, in a language described as "simple", to get into the game of
        coercing types at all.

        All the remaining binops require numeric values.

        I *think* the only possible exceptions from these arithmetic ops are
        ValueError from float conversion, and ZeroDivisionError from divide.
