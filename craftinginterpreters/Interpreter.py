# Interpret Lox

Interpret and execute Lox code, working on a syntax tree of Stmt objects, as
prepared by Parser.py. Refer to book section 8.1 and forward.

The interpreter is implemented as a "visitor" for the tree composed of Stmt
objects. When interpreting an Expression, it "visits" the tree of Expr
objects. As such it has methods that correspond to (eventually) all of the
methods defined in the StmtVisitor and ExprVisitor classes.

    As with the Scanner and Parser classes, Nystrom expects to report errors
    by calling directly to an error display function in the Lox main class.
    That isn't convenient (or even possible) in Python module structure, so
    again, I'm having an error handler passed in to __init__.

    Utility functions
    -----------------

    U1. Specify what's a truthy Lox value. (Can we get a shout-out to Steven
    Colbert here?) Nystrom specifies Lox to use Ruby's rule, by which only
    false and nil are false -- unlike C and Python, where 0 is also False;
    and unlike Python where a null string or empty collection is False.

    Note in this Python implementation, a Lox nil is represented as None, and
    Lox true and false literals are Python True and False. See Parser.py,
    primary().
    '''
    def isTruthy(self,value)->bool:
        if value is None : return False
        if isinstance(value,bool): return value
        return True
    '''
    U2. Specify the meaning of equality in Lox. nil (None) is equal only to
    itself. I think that Python's rules are the same: (None==None)->True,
    None is not equal to anything else. So I'm just going with the built-in.

        return lhs == rhs

    Statement execution!
    --------------------

    S0. To execute a statement is to visit it with this class.

    Note in 8.1.3 Nystrom makes the point that "Unlike expressions,
    statements produce no values, so the return type of the visit methods is
    Void, not Object." And all his visitXxx methods have an explicit "return
    null". In Python, the default for any method that doesn't execute
    "return" is to return None, so I am not reproducing those "return null"s
    '''
    def execute(self, a_statement:Stmt.Stmt):
        a_statement.accept(self)

    '''
    S1. Execute an expression statement. An expression STATEMENT does not
    return a value. Hence to be useful it must have a side-effect, e.g. a
    function call. (But see one_line_program(), above.)
    '''
    def visitExpression(self, client:Stmt.Expression):
        self.evaluate(client.expression)

    '''
    S2. Execute a print statement
    Note the gimmick of dropping ".0" at the end of integral numbers.
    '''
    def visitPrint(self, client:Stmt.Print):
        value = self.evaluate(client.expression)
        str_value = str(value)

    Sq. Execute a while statement. Set the CONTINUE flag True on entry.

    Sbb. Break statement. Set the magic CONTINUE variable False. That's it.
         The Parser ensures this statement can only exist in the scope
         of a loop. Thus we are sure that CONTINUE has been defined in
         some enclosing scope.
    '''
    def visitBreak(self, client:Stmt.Break):

    S4. Block statement. At visitBlock we create the local scope, but then
    pass execution to a subroutine. Why is not clear as of 8.5.2. Can a block
    be executed from another statement type? Maybe fun?

    In a note, Nystrom observes (correctly IMO) that the handling of the
    environment here is inelegant, but that the alternative is verbose.

    Note on the break statement. When a break is within a block, the block
    should stop processing its list of statements immediately. However a
    break could be nested, for example { if (p) { if (q) { break } } }. A
    break executed at any level within the block should cause the block to
    exit. For this we use the CONTINUE flag set by the break statement.

        Note on try/except/finally: as (apparently) in Java, if self.execute()
        raises an exception, our finally: section will be executed as Python
        unwinds the stack looking for an except: clause to handle the exception.
        This ensures restoration of the enclosing context even after an error.

        find you being "inconsistent". Generally I don't think it is a good
