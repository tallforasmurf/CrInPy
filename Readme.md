This directory contains my version of code found in the book
CRAFTING INTERPRETERS by Bob Nystrom. Online text found at
https://craftinginterpreters.com.

The book teaches via building an interpreter for a small language Lox,
first in Java, then in C. The source for these along with the book are
found in Nystrom's repository at https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters

The purpose of this project is to translate the Java code into Python,
first as a way to prove I understand the book, and second to have
something to do while in CV Quarantine.

Direct quotes from Nystrom's work are kept to a minimum, and only used 
when explaining how or why I did something differently than he.
Hopefully that keeps me within "fair use" bounds.
When anything is unclear,
refer to Nystrom's book or repository for explanations.
