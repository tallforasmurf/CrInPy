This directory contains my version of code found in the book
CRAFTING INTERPRETERS by Bob Nystrom. Online text found at
https://craftinginterpreters.com.

The book teaches via building an interpreter for a small language Lox,
first in Java, then in C. The source for these along with the book are
found at https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters

The purpose of this project is to translate the code into Python,
first as a way to prove I understand the book, and second for to have
something to do while in CV Quarantine.
